      "comment_text": "The percentage cut is definitely annoying, but I believe the move from Maestro to Mastercard has also solved creditcard problems for a lot of people. There were a surprising number of Maestro-only terminals out there that were limited by technology rather than policy.<p>I still don&#x27;t think I can pay for my groceries with my credit card, but that&#x27;s clearly indicated at least. I expect the companies refusing the huge processing fees to block credit cards for years to come until the fees go down. That&#x27;s unfortunate for tourists and immigrants, but mobile payment (bank specific&#x2F;Apple Pay&#x2F;Google Wallet) should work over the standard protocol and otherwise there are still ATMs you can use.",
